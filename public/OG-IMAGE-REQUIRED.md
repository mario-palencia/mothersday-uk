# Open Graph Image Required

## Current Status
The site references `/og-image.jpg` in Open Graph metadata, but this file does not exist in the `public/` directory.

## Required Specifications
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630 pixels (recommended OG image size)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File name**: `og-image.jpg`
- **Location**: `public/og-image.jpg`

## Recommended Content
The image should include:
- "Celebrate Valentine's" branding
- Valentine's Day theme (hearts, romantic imagery)
- Text: "Find the Perfect Valentine's Day Gifts & Experiences"
- Brand colors: Pink gradient (#FF1493 to #FF6B9D)

## Temporary Solution
Until the OG image is created, you can:
1. Use an existing image from `public/images/posters/` as a temporary placeholder
2. Create a simple branded image using design tools
3. Use an online OG image generator

## Impact
Without the OG image:
- Social media shares will not display a preview image
- Lower engagement on social platforms
- Reduced click-through rates from social shares
